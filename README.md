# Programming best practises
  Early return statement
  Single responsibility


# Run a JavaScript file
node index.js

JavaScript is a dynamically typed language (not static typed)



# Primitives
String
Number
Boolean
undefined
null

typeof myVariable
The default value of a variable is undefined

# Reference types
Object
Array
Function

// Object literal (JSON)
let person = {
name: 'Mosh',
age: 30
}


# Operators (operands)
Arithmetic
Assignment
Comparison
  - Strict equality === (Type + Value)
  - Lose equality == (Value)
Logical
Bitwise

Ternary (conditional operator)


# Logical comparison with non-boolean value 

Falsy (false)
  undefined
  null
  0
  false
  ''
  NaN (Not a Number)

Anything that is not False -> Truthy

Shot-circuiting



# Conditional statements
if...else
switch...case


# Loops
for
while
do while
for-in (used to iterate over the properties of an object)
for-of (used to iterate over an array)

# Break and Continue
break (break out of the loop)
continue (jump to the next iteration)



# Object
  Factory method
  Constructor
